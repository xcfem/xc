Verification tests concerning the computation of different magnitudes of frequent use in limit state verification, for example:

- Envelope of internal forces: a diagram that shows the extreme maximum and minimum values of internal forces (axial force, shear force, and bending moment) at every point along a structural member.
- Envelope of displacements.
