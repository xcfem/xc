# Zero length elements verification tests
A zero length element has two nodes at the same location. A zeroLength element is similar to a set of springs placed between two nodes, each spring providing the force displacement relationship for a specified degree-of-freedom. The nodes are connected by multiple UniaxialMaterial objects, which provide the force-deformation relationship for the element in that degree-of-freedom direction.

This directory contains some verification tests related with this type of element.
