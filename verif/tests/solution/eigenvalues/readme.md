# Eigenvalue computation
Verification tests related to the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Eigenvalues frequently appear in structural analysis. The most common cases are vibration frequencies and eigenvalues in the form of load magnitudes in structural stability analysis.

In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The corresponding eigenvalue, often denoted by $\lambda$, is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.

Geometrically, an eigenvector, corresponding to a real nonzero eigenvalue, points in a direction in which it is stretched by the transformation and the eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is negative, the direction is reversed. Loosely speaking, in a multidimensional vector space, the eigenvector is not rotated.
