# Mesh generation tests

This directory contains examples of mesh generation. The graphics output code in some examples is commented out. You can see the results of these examples by uncommenting this code. 

## Structured meshes
The tests named `test\_surface_meshing\_XX.py` generate regular quad meshes from quadrilateral surfaces. 

## Paving algorithm

The tests named `test\_paving\_XX.py` use the paving algorithm (see `/usr/local/src/prg/xc/src/utility/paving/Paver.h` and `src/preprocessor/multi_block_topology/entities/2d/PolygonalFace.h`).
