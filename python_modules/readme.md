# XC Python modules

Python modules to:

- Simplify the execution of the most common tasks.
- Implement features for which it's not necessary to use C++ (limit state checking, graphical output, text output,...).
- Integrate the C++ libraries with other software packages (numpy, scipy, VTK, LaTeX,...).
