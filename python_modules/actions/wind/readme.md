# Wind loads

The most common lateral load is a wind load. The Eiffel Tower is one example of a building which has a structure that was designed to resist a high wind load. Wind against a building builds up a positive pressure on the windward side and a negative pressure (or suction) on the leeward side. Depending upon the shape of the structure it may also cause a negative pressure on the side walls or even the roof. The pressure on the walls and roof is not uniform, but varies across the surface. Winds can apply loads to structures from unexpected directions. Thus, a designer must be well aware of the dangers implied by this lateral load. The magnitude of the pressure that acts upon the surfaces is proportional to the square of the wind speed.

The modules on this folder compute the loads due to wind according to the following codes:
