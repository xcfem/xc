Transient integrators
=====================

Determing the next time step for an analysis including inertial effects can be done by one the following schemes:

- Newmark -- The two parameter time-stepping method developed by Newmark
- HHT -- The three parameter Hilbert-Hughes-Taylor time-stepping method
- Central Difference -- Approximates velocity and acceleration by centered finite differences of displacement
