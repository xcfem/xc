# Recorders
Recorders are introduced to allow information (displacements, internal forces, reactions, strains, stresses,...) to be saved during the analysis.

Once the model and analysis objects have been defined, the analyst has the option of specifying what is to be monitored during the analysis. This, for example, could be the displacement history at a node in a transient analysis or the entire state of the model at each step in the solution procedure. Several Recorder objects are created by the analyst to monitor the analysis.
