### Geometric nonlinearity for beam column elements.
To capture the P-little delta effecs in beam elements you need to use at least six ordinary beam column elements (ForceBeamColumn, ElasticBeam, etc.) because they are not capable of handling geometric nonlinearity _within_ the basic system. As an alternative, we need to implement [ForceBeamColumnCDBI](https://github.com/OpenSees/OpenSees/blob/master/SRC/element/forceBeamColumn/ForceBeamColumnCBDI3d.h) and [MixedBeamColumn](https://github.com/OpenSees/OpenSees/tree/master/SRC/element/mixedBeamColumn) which can handle geometric nonlinearity inside the element itself.
