# Coordinate transformations

The geometric-transformation classes are used to construct a coordinate-transformation (CrdTransf) object, which transforms beam element stiffness and resisting force from the basic system to the global-coordinate system.


## Rigid joint offsets

The geometric coordinate transformation objects handle rigid joint offsets for frame elements. In this [post](https://portwooddigital.com/2020/11/19/rigid-joint-offsets/) you can find a description of how it works.
